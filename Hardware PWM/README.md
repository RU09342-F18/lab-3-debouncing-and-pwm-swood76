# Hardware PWM
Included in this repository is two examples of Hardware PWM implemented on two TI launchpads: MSP430G2553 and MSP430FR2311. The program(s) function identically in that they both utilize two interrupts: Port1 and TIMERX_XX such that at the start an onboard LED is on at 50 % duty cyle and as the PWM is less than the desired value of 1000, the duty cycle is incremented to 100 % from 0-1000 through the use of PORT1 and TIMERX_XX interrupt. Both programs required the configuration of their own unique timers to be able to simulate PWM to their respective OUTPUT pins, and required research into specific modes the timers can be configured to was necessary, prior to creating hardware PWM. For example, the datasheet for the MSP430G2553 requires that the output pin 1.6 be configured to TimerA0; as a result, the special function register for this specific outpout pin was enabled and set high to allow for the PWM ability, where as, for the MSP430FR2311 the timerB module was utilized. More information regarding the setup, the reason why the program functions on each board, or why a certain timer mode was selected can be found within the main.c file for each board.
